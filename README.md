## Web Application

[//]: # (***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***)

The goal of our app is to create a simple aesthetic interface to help user's stay focused, motivated, and on task. We used a combination of Tailwind and React to create a clean and easy to navigate user experience that reduces stress to help accomplish their goals. We added a Django backend to store user information and make api calls for quick, error free functionality.
